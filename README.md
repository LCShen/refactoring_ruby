## Refactoring Ruby Edition
The code examples in [the book][1] on refactoring don’t include tests.

I would like to practice TDD and refactoring on green. Thus, before starting to
refactor, I write a test. Then while refactoring, I try and make one-line
changes, rerun the tests after every single change, and commit if they are
green.

## Kindle Locations

If you’re like me, you are
- reading [the book][1] by Jay Fields, Shane Harvie, and Martin Fowler
- following along with the [Ruby Book Club][2] podcast by Nadia and Saron

There’s a slight problem: the podcast episodes are delimited by __page
numbers__.  Kindle doesn’t have those. And if you purchased the Kindle eBook
from Amazon, you likely don’t even have access to the PDF version, which has
the page numbers.

Use these Kindle locations to keep your reading progress in sync with the podcast:

1. [Refactoring Ruby - Ep 1 (Foreword - Ch 1, pg 7)][01] ends at Kindle location 375
2. [Refactoring Ruby - Ep 2 (Ch 1, pg 7-18)][02] – location 375 to 468
3. [Refactoring Ruby - Ep 3 (Ch 1, pg 18-50)][03] – location 468 to 607
4. [Refactoring Ruby - Ep 4 (Ch 2, pg 51-61)][04] – location 615 to 800
5. [Refactoring Ruby - Ep 5 (Ch 2, pg 61-72)][05] – location 800 to 1026
6. [Refactoring Ruby - Ep 6 (Ch 6, pg 101-110)][06] – location 1464 to 1567
7. [Refactoring Ruby - Ep 7 (Ch 6, pg 111-124)][07] – location 1580 to 1713
